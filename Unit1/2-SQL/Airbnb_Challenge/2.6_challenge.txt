    - The most expensive listings are tied at $10,000 per night in the neighborhoods of Ocean Beach and Core. It's for the entire home and they are available for 143 out of 365 days of the year.

    What time of year is the cheapest time to go to your city? What about the busiest?
    
    ***Using calendar.csv***
    - 1) After combining the years by month, January appears to be the cheapest time to go to Portland at an average of $103/night.
    - SQL query
SELECT
    AVG(price::numeric),
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)
FROM
    calendar
GROUP BY 2
ORDER BY AVG ASC

    - 2) The busiest time of year would be when there are less listings marked as "available"
    - I hesitate to trust this data because it only provides date for the future, and I don't believe 11/2019 has less listings marked as available because visitors have already booked their stay. In any case, if there was better prior data from last year, I would use the following query.
    - SQL query
SELECT 
    to_char(date, 'YYYY-MM'),
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    calendar
WHERE available='t'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY count DESC


    ***Using just the listings.csv***
    - Airbnb says 70% of visits result in a listing review. To calculate total review:
    	Estimated total stay = # Reviews / 0.70

    - thought process for 1) there is no time-dependent listing price data (just that of the most recent scraping); instead, consider the least busy time of year because that will lead to more options for cheaper fares
    -The month that would be easiest to get cheaper fares is in January, where there are 4841 reviews, or approximately 6916 bookings. This is the lowest bookings by month, therefore, there is a greater chance a visitor can get the best rates - especially if hosts are willing to offer discounts.

    -SQL Query:
SELECT
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date),
    Count(*)
FROM 
    reviews
WHERE date BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-12-31'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY count DESC


    - thought process for 2) count the amount of reviews in each month.
    - July is the most popular with 12403 reviews, or approximately 17719 total reviews. August is a close second with 10688 reivews and 15269 estimated total reviews.
