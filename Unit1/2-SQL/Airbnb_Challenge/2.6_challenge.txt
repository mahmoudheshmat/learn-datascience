    What time of year is the cheapest time to go to your city? What about the busiest?
    
    - Airbnb says 70% of visits result in a listing review. To calculate total review:
    	Estimated total stay = # Reviews / 0.70

    - thought process for 1) there is no time-dependent listing price data (just that of the most recent scraping); instead, consider the least busy time of year because that will lead to more options for cheaper fares
    -The month that would be easiest to get cheaper fares is in January, where there are 4841 reviews, or approximately 6916 bookings. This is the lowest bookings by month, therefore, there is a greater chance a visitor can get the best rates - especially if hosts are willing to offer discounts.

    -SQL Query:
SELECT
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date),
    Count(*)
FROM 
    reviews
WHERE date BETWEEN '2017-01-01' AND '2017-12-31'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY count DESC


    - thought process for 2) count the amount of reviews in each month.
    - July is the most popular with 12403 reviews, or approximately 17719 total reviews. August is a close second with 10688 reivews and 15269 estimated total reviews.
