    "It's come time to address another potential source of error in our models: overfitting. __Overfitting__ is when your model is so excessively complex that it starts to catch random noise instead of describing the true underlying relationships. This is typically manifested with a model that evaluates as more accurate than it really is. In most situations you shouldn't be able to build a perfect model, some error is to be expected. Overfitting is extremely common and easy to do, but there are ways to guard against it. The main way is through how you evaluate your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far we've been using our training data to evaluate our model. By this we mean that we've used the same data to train the model and to see how well the model is doing. When you think about it, some of the danger of that approach may become apparent. If we create a very elaborate model it will pick up on the nuances of the data that are just from random noise.  If we evaluate the model on the training data, that ability to pick up noise will be returned as accuracy. In reality, this isn't the case and doesn't depict how we'd really want to evaluate a model. Generally we don't care about predicting things we already know. We care about other data, new information, or other situations. This is why testing with training data really isn't what we want to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "But if that's the case, what can we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Holdout Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to combat overfitting is with a **holdout group** (or sometimes \"holdback group\"). All this means is that you do not include all of your data in your training set, instead reserving some of it exclusively for testing. While there is a cost to having less training data, your evaluation will be far more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When directly comparing two models that are based on different techniques or different specifications, this holdout method combats overfitting. Overfit models will see a drop in success rate outside of their training data, and so their performance will not be artificially inflated as it would be if you trained and validated your model using the whole data set. This is because they got really good at matching the patterns within the data they were trained with, but didn't actually learn the things that matter but random noise. When they try to match that random noise on new data their accuracy suffers.\n",
    "\n",
    "How much data you choose to keep in a holdout is really up to you and depends on how much and what kind of data you have to begin with as well as what kind of model you're training. You should check and see how much variance your model has as you add more data as well as how much data it would take to maintain a reasonably representative test sample. It is, however, a balance. 30% is a common starting point, but really anything from 50% to 1% of the original dataset could be reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems relatively simple to code up. We'll try it below with our spam model:\n"

The number of folds you create is up to you, but it will depend on how much data you want in your testing set. At its most extreme, you're creating the same number of folds as you have observations in your data set. This kind of cross validation has a special name: __Leave One Out__.

    "How you choose to validate your model in real life will depend upon the kind of data you're working with and the kinds of concerns you have about the model's performance. Remember, your model is trained to fit the data you feed it, so if the situation changes your model will become less accurate. For example, if there are seasonal changes to your observed variable but you only train on one month's data, you're going to have a problem. You could test that by seeing how accurate your model is with a specific time period as your holdout, rather than a random sample. We'll cover techniques for dealing with time more later.\n",

    "Overfitting is always possible, but some models are more susceptible to it than others. Naive Bayes is actually pretty good for avoiding overfitting. This is largely because the assumptions are so simple, particularly the assumed independence between any two independent variables. One of the sources of overfitting is when a model tries to map complex interactions between variables that aren't really there or significant. Naive Bayes cannot do this because it assumes they are all independent and therefore not interacting. It's a nice characteristic at times, but it does mean it doesn't take into account how your features affect each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, one final note on our models here. They weren't overfitting, but they weren't telling us much either. They were just barely more accurate than the dominant class. Discuss with your mentor why that is and what you could do to improve the model.\n"
