1. probability of flipping a balanced coin 4x and getting: HTTH, HHHH, TTHH

- independent expt's with equal probability of H or T
P(any) = 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/16

2. list of people has 24 women, 21 men. probability of choosing a man is 21/45. probability of not choosing a man?

P(woman) = 24/45

3. probability that Bernice will travel by plane in the next year is 10%. prob of plane crash is 0.005%. probability Bernice will crash in the next yr?

- assuming Bernice 10% chance of traveling once (one-way flight)
P(Bernice in plane crash) = 0.10 * 0.00005 = 0.000005 = 0.0005%
- assuming roundtrip, then need to multiply the probability by itself

4. 5% chance a user is asked to do survey after clicking a link. DS then concludes from survey data that users spend 15 mins surfing the company website before moving on

- there is a sampling bias in that voluntary survey participants do not represent all website users
- I'd go as far to say it's likely an overestimate since survey participants seem to have time to kill, and thus may spend more time on a web site than those who did not participate in the survey
- from *solutions*: people who surf longer likely to click more links and increase odds of getting survey
	- I see this as a 2nd reason for an overestimated value
