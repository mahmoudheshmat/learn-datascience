# Scenario:
## 3 doors to pick from
1. fantastic prize
2. dud
3. dud

You pick a door. Host opens up one of the other two to reveal a dud, do you change your mind and pick the remaining door?

Yes; you have 1/3 chance of being correct with your first choice, which does not change after the lateral door is revealed. Because that continues to be a 1/3 changes of being right, there is a 2/3 chance remaining if you select the other remaining option, i.e. the 2nd door.

How would the Bayes' Rule apply?

Because the host knows what's behind the doors, and he decides which door to open before allowing you to switch, the probability of the 2nd door remaining is conditional upon your initial decision (s/he's not gonna open the door you selected, or one of the correct doors).

P(A |B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)
