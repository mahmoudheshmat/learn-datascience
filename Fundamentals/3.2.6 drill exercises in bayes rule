Scenario: Diagnostic test as 98% probability of a positive result with someone suffering T-disease and 10% chance of giving a false positive. estimated T-disease in 0.5% of population

Intuitions:
- the test will be positive close to 0.55% of the time if given to everyone in population
- the test will correctly diagnose a sufferer < 10% of the time
- the test will correctly identify a non-sufferer roughly 90% of the time
- the test will misclassify a person close to 10% of the time


Calculated:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * [P(A) / P(B)]
- P(A) is the probability of having TD
- P(B) is the probability of a positive result for TD
- P(A | B) is the probability of having TD if given a positive result
- P(B | A) is the probability of a positive result if actually having TD


P(positive test) = P(false positive)*negative_population * P(true positive)*postive_population
	= (0.10) * (0.995) + (0.98) * (0.005)
	= 0.1044 = 10.44%


P(true positive test result) = 98%, as stated in prompt


P(true negative test result) = 90%, as stated in prompt


P(mis-classify the person) = (0.02*0.005 + 0.10*0.995)
	= 0.996
	- why can't I subtract true pos + true neg from 1? this would leave all false results behind
		- you can. i forgot to multiply by population %
